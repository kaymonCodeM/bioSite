            Hannah is an inspiring artist. She is passionate about her artwork and people around her.
            Hannah fights for peoples right while at the same time making great artwork.
            She was a Seventh-day Adventist growing up, so she attended private schools
            that unfortunately did not have art classes due to the funding. Hannah had to learn
            artwork on her own with the limited tools given to her. Her supplies came from her parents
            and gifts from friends. When she graduated high school, she did not know exactly what she wanted
            to do. When she first started college, she only knew that she wanted to do something with art. Hannah first
            attended at Union College,
            in Lincoln, Nebraska as an Art Education major.

            Hannah is also very spontaneous. Hannah went to Italy the start of her
            sophomore year with only $2000 to live on throughout the whole year. Once Hannah came back from Italy her
            junior year,
            she then decided to change her major to Studio Art to acquire more art skills. At this point her true
            accomplishments begins.

            Hannah graduated with her bachelors while being a Social Vice President on the ASB organization. This
            organization is known as the Associated Student Body that creates events for the whole school.

            Hannah is now studying at the University of Nebraska Lincoln to achieve her master’s in Art History. While
            studying at UNL she also is working at the Great Plains Art Museum. She is extremely talented which got her
            the
            opportunity to curate her own show using the museum’s permanent art holdings and collection. This was huge
            for her because
            she was able to show how people express women being seen within a painting and how people perceive them.
            Hannah is devoted to human
            rights as she also donated art pieces to the Black Lives Matter Lincoln Chapter action. These art pieces
            acquired a significant price,
            so it was a huge personal accomplishment because it for an organization she was inspired by and passionate
            about. If you ever want to see
            Hannah’s artwork you can see it inside the Noyes Gallery. She is also doing her fourth Art and Garden show
            this year at the Sunken Gardens
            at the beginning of September.
